How about transfering Ugandan Shillings to an address without having to change to some other currency?

### Main motivation

Give the common people (Ugandans, majorly ) to interact with blockchain both directly (developers ) and indirectly (products built ) using this token as an entry point.

### Development Environment

I used the following tools during the development:

```bash

- Nodejs v14.16.0
- Solc v6.14.11

```
