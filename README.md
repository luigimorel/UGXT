### Introduction

How about transfering Ugandan Shillings to an address without having to change to some other currency?

### Main motivation

Give the common people (Ugandans, majorly ) to interact with blockchain both directly (developers ) and indirectly (products built ) using this token as an entry point.

### Development Environment

I used the following tools during the development:

```bash

- Nodejs v14.16.0
- Solc v6.14.11

```

### TO DO

[] Add a fail-safe mechanisms for the new contract
[] Restrict the amount of tokens that can be stored in the contract
[x] Use the Check-Effects-Interactions patterns to verify the withdraw of the token
[x] Handle authorization for the users within the contract itself
[x] Add the SafeMath library that can be used to avoid malicious attacks
